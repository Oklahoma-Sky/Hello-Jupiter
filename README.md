Create a respository

This is Skyler Oates.  Creating this first respository, and engaging with Github, marks an important milestone in my personal and professional life.  A couple of years ago, my interest in programming was renewed while studying how Thinkscript code could be used to automate the ThinkorSwim trading platform.  Since that time, I have become fascinated with coding and its potential utility in the area of data science. When I was younger, I would walk the alleyways looking for scrap pieces of metal, springs, hydraulics, wiring, and computer parts - hoping to build a real robot using a Texas Instruments Speak and Spell for the brain.  Maybe I can still do that...Wow!
